# ATM Interface

This Java application simulates a basic ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface. It provides users with the following functionalities:

* **Withdraw:** Allows users to withdraw funds from their bank account.
* **Deposit:** Allows users to deposit funds into their bank account.
* **Check Balance:** Displays the current balance of the user's bank account.

### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/atm-interface.git
   ```
2. **Compile the Code:**
   ```bash
   javac ATMInterface.java
   ```
3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   java ATMInterface
   ```

### Classes and Functionality

* **ATM:** The main class that represents the ATM machine. It handles user input, validates transactions, and interacts with the BankAccount class.
* **BankAccount:** Represents the user's bank account. It stores the account balance and provides methods for withdrawing and depositing funds.

### Customization

You can customize the initial balance of the bank account by modifying the `BankAccount` constructor in the `ATMInterface` class.

### Future Enhancements

* Implement additional features like PIN authentication, transaction history, and interest calculation.
* Integrate with a real-time database to store and manage account information.
* Add error handling and exception handling for robust operation.
